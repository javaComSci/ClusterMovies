# ClusterMovies

1. Clean data for all the movies and plots and choose a subset by removing stop words, stemming, and removing noise
2. Calculate tf-idf vectors for all the terms in the corpus
3. Fit K-means clustering on different clusters to find best number of clusters (K-means clustering from Scikit-Learn)
4. All movies in the same cluster are more similar to each other than they are to other movies in other clusters
